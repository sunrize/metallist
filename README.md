This is a conceptual description of the software to solve my problems with media server automation that I encounter when using Sonarr and other applications.

Perhaps some of my problems have already been solved by software that I am not aware of.

# Basic outline

Basic flow of the automated media server:
1. Add to list
2. Download files
3. Organize files
4. Serve files

There are a huge number of services and databases, and the problem is that different software allows you to use different sets of services and each in its own way.
