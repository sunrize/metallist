This is a conceptual description of a software solution to my problems with media server automation, which I encounter when using Sonarr and other applications. It is possible that some of these problems have already been addressed by software that I am unaware of.

There is a vast array of services and databases available, and the challenge is that different software applications allow you to utilize different sets of these services and databases in their own unique ways.

The main goal is to create a self-hosted service that can track content consumption and update external lists. Additionally, this service can be used to provide metadata to other applications within the media stack, as well as provide instructions or tools for editing the original metadata sources.
